# mdtablesparser

Parse markdown tables (without header) with a tiny javascript file.

## Hint

Javascript uses ES6. You may run this snippet on all current versions of Chrome without the need of compiling it back to ES5\. If you want to be able to use it on older browsers please add some babel package (NPM stuff) on your own ;)

The `css`folder also contains a `scss` version ;)
